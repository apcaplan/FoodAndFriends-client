### Problem Statement

Our goal is to create a fun and safe experience for singles by creating a virtual dinner party experience with other singles in your community, while supporting a community restaurant. COVID-19 and shelter-in-place orders have led to increased feelings of isolation and loneliness, and have made it more difficult to meet new people and make new friends. At the same time, the restaurant industry is suffering, and ordering delivery is one of the best ways to support the industry safely. Our web app will allow restaurants to host virtual dinner parties by allowing individuals to sign up for a given time slot and meal and utilizing google meet to provide a virtual platform at the scheduled time.

### Executive Summary

Overall, we concluded that we wanted our web app to meet the following needs:
- Support local community restaurants
- Provide a low-commitment, easy to attend space for meeting new people
- Intuitive user flow
- Create a scalable web app that any restaurant with online ordering can use

#### How It Works:
1. A restaurant signs up for this platform and provides a few different dates/times for availability.
2. A customer comes to the website, selects the restaurant and date/time they would like to join, and then goes through the user flow of selecting their food, providing a delivery address/instructions, and payment
3. Orders are submitted to the restaurant and the customer receives a confirmation page and email with the google calendar event, which includes a google meet link
4. Food arrives in time for the event, and customers get to make new friends!


### Outside Research

Our first step was to scour the web for similar ideas - we knew about pre-pandemic hosted dinner parties for strangers, and wanted to investigate how they have pivoted. Many of them have continued to host virtual events - but involve cooking your own meals. For examples, see: [EatWith](https://www.eatwith.com/) and [ChefsFeed](https://experiences.chefsfeed.com/browse/) (previously Feastly). 

There are also a handful of caterers offering virtual dinner party kits for groups - these are offered as coursed out meals, delivered to each participant with reheating instructions. For examples, see: [The Pickled Fork](https://thepickledfork.com/deliveries/virtual-dinner-parties/) and [Dinner by David](https://thepickledfork.com/deliveries/virtual-dinner-parties/).

However, in our research we weren't able to find what we are looking for - specifically, a way to support community restaurants while bringing strangers together. Thus, Food and Friends was born!

### Problem Statement

Our goal is to create a fun and safe experience for singles by creating a virtual dinner party experience with other singles in your community, while supporting a community restaurant. COVID-19 and shelter-in-place orders have led to increased feelings of isolation and loneliness, and have made it more difficult to meet new people and make new friends. At the same time, the restaurant industry is suffering, and ordering delivery is one of the best ways to support the industry safely. Our web app will allow restaurants to host virtual dinner parties by allowing individuals to sign up for a given time slot and meal and utilizing google meet to provide a virtual platform at the scheduled time.
